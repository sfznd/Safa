  <p><h2>Starting point</h2></p>
  <p>Nowadays, the talk around the metaverse has been very everywhere. If it is true that we will all be leading a double virtual life in two years time, then it is essential to seriously consider the values and content that will be in that world.<br> How will it look like, and how should it absolutely not look like?</br></p>
  <p>For example, I have found that many digital fashion brands mainly use white skinny models to display their work, which is a huge lack of representation.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p><b>It is unacceptable that on an interface as polyvalent, free and new we keep up with the same exact discriminatory standards.</b></p>
  <p>If there is a chance to somewhat start again and do better, the metaverse must be it.</p>
  <p>On the other hand, there are already brands that have identified the problem and work towards improving the situation. The Metaverse fashion brand "Placebo" has understood how important the problematic of representation is. In reaction to this phenomenon, Roei Derhi has decided to create " garments [that] are sustainable, ageless, genderless and sizeless". It would be great to continue moving towards that direction of better inclusion and representation.</p>

  <p><h2>Reference/Inspiration</h2></p>
  <p> Considering how complex this topic is and how little time 5 days is to properly answer to it, I had to find a way to efficiently structure these new "principles" I wanted to share. <br>Sister Corita Kent's work has inspired me a lot. She has made this set of 10 rules to use as a guide for any art student to structure their practice and learning journey. Just like these rules serve as a guide to better navigate the creative "world", my outcome could borrow its structure and become a guide on how to navigate the digital world as a creative.</br></p>
  <p></p>

  <p></p>
  <p>These rules were inspired by her own experience and conversations she had with people surrounding her. They were carefully crafted. I do not believe my sole insights are enough to craft a meaningful and relevant list of rules. For that reason, I have decided to create a space where people would be able to share about this topic and <b>together</b> come up with an inlcusive and respectful guide.</p>
